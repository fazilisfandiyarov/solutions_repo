1. The Expansion of the Universe (Hubble's Law)
This is the most direct and fundamental observational basis of the theory. It is based on Edwin Hubble's observations.

Observation: The light from distant galaxies is redshifted, similar to how the pitch of a siren drops as it moves away. And the farther away a galaxy is, the faster it appears to be receding.

Mathematical Expression (Hubble's Law):
v = H₀ * d

v: The galaxy's recession velocity (km/s)

d: The distance to the galaxy (Megaparsec - Mpc)

H₀: Hubble Constant (approximately 70 km/s/Mpc). This constant gives the current expansion rate of our universe.

A Simple Calculation Example:
Let's assume we have a galaxy at a distance of 100 Mpc (approximately 326 million light-years).
v = 70 km/s/Mpc * 100 Mpc = 7000 km/s
This means that galaxy is receding from us at a speed of 7000 kilometers per second.

2. Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMB)
This can be thought of as the "residual heat" of the early universe and is the strongest evidence for the Big Bang.

Origin: When the universe was about 380,000 years old, it cooled enough for electrons and protons to combine and form neutral hydrogen atoms ("Recombination"). From this moment on, light could travel freely. That first light, stretched into the microwave wavelength due to the expansion of the universe, now fills the entire sky as radiation with a temperature of 2.7 Kelvin (-270.45°C).

Importance: This radiation is like a photograph of the universe's early stages and is one of the most fundamental predictions of the Big Bang theory.

3. Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (Abundance of Light Elements)
This postulate explains the origin of the lightest elements in the universe, such as hydrogen, helium, and lithium.

Process: For the first few minutes after the Big Bang, the universe was so hot and dense that fundamental particles like protons and neutrons could collide and fuse to form the first atomic nuclei.

Calculation and Prediction: The theory predicts that this process should have resulted in baryonic matter (normal matter) being approximately 75% Hydrogen, 25% Helium by mass, with very small amounts of Deuterium and Lithium-7. Astronomical observations have measured abundances throughout the universe that are consistent with these predictions. This agreement is very strong evidence for the theory's correctness.

4. The Origin and Evolution of the Universe
The three observations above point to a single logical conclusion: The universe is a dynamic system with a beginning that is constantly evolving.

Conclusion: If the universe is expanding, it was smaller and denser in the past. If we rewind time, all matter and energy converge towards an extremely dense and hot singularity. This is considered the "Big Bang" moment. From this moment on, the universe, expanding and cooling, formed the structures that created stars, galaxies, and eventually us.

In summary, the four main pillars of the Big Bang theory are:

The expansion of the universe, proven by Hubble's Law.

The fossil radiation permeating everywhere, called the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation.

The perfect match between the observed abundances of light elements and the theory.

The idea, indicated by all of these, that the universe had a beginning and has evolved.
